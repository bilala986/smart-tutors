                                My daughter who is in Year 7 now is attending since she was in year 5 and i have no problems with her grades and progress.
                                Teachers are amazing and providing all the help & support my child needs to excel more.
                                The small class size ensures excellent involvement between child and teacher.
                                Its absolutely a safest place for a child to attend during this pandemic  and i trust them completely.
                                I have been very impressed with all the feedback and communication to keep me informed about my child progress regularly.
                                I would highly recommend Smart Tutors.

                                We are absolutely delighted with the support we have received from Smart tutor and  with the one to one tutoring our son has received over the past few months. Tutor Doctor carefully assessed our son’s learning needs and ideal learning styles. They then very thoughtfully matched our son with the most superb tutor imaginable; they get on so well together and our son is really thriving and learning fast in a way that really works for him. The tutor is so accommodating and flexible in arranging tutoring times direct with our daughter. Everything has been superb. We cannot recommend Smart tutor enough.

                                The Smart Tutors provided excellent, uninterrupted education to my daughter throughout the year leading up to her 11+. Teachers are very professional, committed and gave individual attention to my daughter to overcome her weakness in maths and science. Even with COVID 19 restrictions the support and education offered to the children was fantastic and consistent which I am very grateful for. My daughter worked so hard and along with the additional support from Smart Tutors, she really has grown in confidence and achieved so much. I could not be more thankful and definitely I would highly Recommend Smart Tutors.
